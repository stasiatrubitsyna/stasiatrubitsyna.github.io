<h1>Definitions of robots</h1>

<p>'Robot' comes from the Czech word Robota meaning serf or slave – it was defined in Karel Capek’s drama Rossum’s Universal Robots, RUR, 1921</p>

Robot Institute of America definition:

    “A robot is a re-programmable multi-functional manipulator designed to move materials, parts, tools or specialised devices, through variable programmed motions for the purpose of a variety of tasks.”

However there are some more controversial definitions like the Datatronics.net definition:

    “A program that automatically searches the world wide web for files”

Or Douglas Adams’, in Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy:

    “Your plastic pal who is fun to be with!”

There are lots of different ways of thinking of robots. In the discussion below, describe your definition of a robot. Try and be creative in your answer and stick to using your own words.
